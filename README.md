# FractalWorld
Very interesting side project around Mandelbrot's and Julia's representations (Fractal world <3) âœ¨
In this project, I used Processing (Java) in order to develop it ðŸ”¥
I did a very simple implementation of the complex world and I manipulate shaders with a GLSL program ðŸ’¥
First graphic program that I put here ;)
