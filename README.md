# FractalWorld
Very interesting side project around Mandelbrot's and Julia's representations (Fractal world <3) âœ¨ <br>
In this project, I used Processing (Java) in order to develop it ðŸ”¥ <br>
I did a very simple implementation of the complex world and I manipulate shaders with a GLSL program ðŸ’¥ <br>
First graphic program that I put here ;) <br><br>
